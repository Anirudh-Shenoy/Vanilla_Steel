This was for the Vanilla Steel Case

TASK 1 

The python notebook contains information on how to clean the data, parse it and then join it on material name as that seemed to be the column with the most matches. An outer join has been performed to preserve the records that we need and has all the information from both sheets. The names have been matched across the sheets with the column mapping. To run the code, one must simply upload the sheets to their local google drive path and run the exectuable. 

TASK 2 

Looker studio dashboard has been created using the account manager share calculation and the dashboard displays the various metrics from the supplier and buyer point of view. The shareable link has been provided to view the dashboard with it's basic contents. The dashboard can be enhanced based on further requirements and metrics required. 

TASK 3 

The sql query has been generated for a buyer preference matching with a few criteria to be checked after preprocessing and sampling the data. To run the query, one must upload the tables to their database environment and might have to modify the query for the path, apart from that the remaining code remains the same.
